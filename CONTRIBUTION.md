# How to contribute
If you have a suggestion for a project or category that should be added, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/elvelive/project-ideas/issues) or create a [pull request](https://github.com/elvelive/project-ideas/pulls) after you have made the changes to the README. If you add a project, make sure it is under the right category.
